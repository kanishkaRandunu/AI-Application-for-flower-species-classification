# AI Programming with Python Project

Project code for Udacity's AI Programming with Python Nanodegree program. In this project, I first develop code for an image classifier built with PyTorch, then convert it into a command line application. I have used transfer learning for image classification and pytorch has been used for model development.

Dataset : https://www.robots.ox.ac.uk/~vgg/data/flowers/102/index.html

Use following to run the training file.

python _train.py --data_dir  flowers/

Use following to run the predict file.

python _predict.py --checkpoint my_model_checkpoint.pth
